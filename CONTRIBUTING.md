### How to set up and write tests
1. Make sure that all the required packages are installed via `uv pip install -e ".[dev]"`
2. If you need to install additional packages needed for your tests, add them in the section `[project.optional-dependencies]` in `mossball/pyproject.toml` file.
3. If you want to write UI tests using Selenium:
    - Create a Marimo notebook by typing `marimo edit tests/notebooks/{name of notebook}` on Terminal
    - Inside the notebook, add any plugins that you want to test (see other notebook files as an example)
    - If you want to test backend-supported plugin alongside your UI tests, then in `conftest.py`, add the mock response data (see `dummy_data` as an example)
    - Add any functions that mock the desired backend calls, like how `mock_verify_plugin` and `mock_get_plugin` do
    - Create a test file under `tests/testfiles`
    - Write any testing scenarios that you want
4. If you want to write unit tests for the plugin backend:
    - Add any additional helper functions to simulate the institution backend database and responses in `mock_inst.py` (currently, the mock institution data comes from `backends/institution/dummy_data.py`)
    - Add more tests for different endpoints in `test_backend.py`, or create a new file under `tests/testfiles` and be sure to use a [pytest fixture](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/testing/) to set up the Flask test client (see `test_backend.py` for an example)
    - You can make changes to the local plugin database using MongoDB [collection methods](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/js-collection/) on the "institutions" collection, such as `db.institutions.delete_one(...)` or `db.institutions.insert_one(...)`
    - Use `client.session_transaction()` to access the session login data, and use `mock.patch()` to simulate requests to an institution backend (see `test_query_plugin` in `test_backend.py` for an example)

### How to run the tests
1. Make sure that all the required packages are installed via `uv pip install -e ".[dev]"`
2. Under the root directory `mossball`, run `pytest` to run all the tests
    - If you want to run a specific test file, run `pytest tests/testfiles/{test file name}`
    - If you want to run a specific test case under the specific file, run `pytest tests/testfiles/{test file name}::{test function name}`

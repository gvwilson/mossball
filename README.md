# Mossball

[Marimo][marimo] is a computational notebook
that lets data scientists mix code, discussion, and results.
Its plugin system relies on [AnyWidget][anywidget],
which specifies a simple contract between extensions and Marimo.
The aim of this project is to design, build, and test a set of Marimo plugins
for classroom exercises similar to those in [H5P][h5p]:
multiple choice, fill in the blanks, and so on.

## Setup

1.  Clone [this repository][repo].

1.  Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
    -   E.g., if you are using [uv][uv], run `uv venv` and then `source .venv/bin/activate`.

1.  Install the dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.
    -   E.g., run `uv pip install -r pyproject.toml`.

You may also want to clone the [Marimo repository][marimo-repo].

## Research and Possible Plugins

### Initial Feedback and General Findings

### Suggested H5P Plugins and Comparisons to Other Implementations

<p>Below are a few of the H5P plugins suggested by professors and students, along with some differences noted between the H5P versions and those from other online learning platforms:</p>

<td>Multiple Choice</td>
<td><ul>
<li>Each choice is initially a grey box </li>
<li>When you hover over a choice, the colour of the box changes to light grey</li>
<li>When you select the option, the colour changes to blue, the circle is filled in, and the whole box becomes outlined with a thicker blue border which becomes thinner again once you click away</li>
</ul></td>
<td><u>Quercus</u><ul>
<li>All boxes are always white</li>
<li>When the option is selected, only the circle is filled in</li>
</ul>
<u>D2L</u>
<ul>
<li>All boxes are initially white </li>
<li>When you hover over it, the box changes to grey, and the circleâ€™s outline becomes thicker and changes from grey to blue</li>
<li>When you select an option, the box becomes blue and the circle is filled in; the outline remains blue until you click away on something else</li>
</ul></td>
<td><ul>
<li>For quizzes, having the boxes and background as both white is more consistent and less distracting</li>
<li>For small exercises in between a lecture or reading, giving the boxes a different colour can help the exercise to stand out from the rest of the page content; however, this might look awkward if the text for the choices is long or different sizes</li>
<li>Having the box change colour on hover and on click is useful, as makes it obvious to the student which option they selected</li>
</ul></td>

# Drag the words : Design

### Introduction
This document contains the logs about the process of making the Drag-the-words plugin.

### Initial Stage
Before starting the sketch, I first searched a few references, such as [H5P](https://h5p.org/drag-the-words) and [ispring](https://ispringhelpdocs.com/qm11/drag-the-words-62856611.html). Then, I broke down into 5 main flows of using this plugin and drew multiple possible designs for each scenario:

1. the user opens the question for the first time
2. the user drags the word(s)
3. the user doesn't finish dragging all the words but try to submit their answers
4. the user checks the result
5. the user retries the question

### Feedback
After finishing the initial sketch of the plugin, I asked 4 students for their opinion about the design and suggestion for improvement. I collected and documented all the feedback in this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/130sILIUKbuvlaF_NX-XJerBZDoY52BxqU5w4ye4P-A8/edit?usp=sharing)


### Improvement
Based on the feedback that I've received, I modified and created the mock-ups using Figma for the better understanding. You can visit [this link] to see the enhanced design.
